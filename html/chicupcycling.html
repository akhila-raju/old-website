            <p>Chic Upcycling was a project for <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/2015/08/interactive-seating-new-course-models-design-innovation-education">Interactive Seating</a>, the first ever Design Innovation Course in UC Berkeley's Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation. The chair is made from an upcycled wine box, upcycled stuffing, upcycled foam, nails, wool, wood stain, and spray paint.</p>

               <h2>Design Problem</h2>
               <p>In this assignment we are exploring the combination of hard and soft materials as the relate to seating experiences. The deliverable is a seat mounted to a base that the instructor provides. The seat must bear a weight of 300 lbs, and must be designed according to a Hexagram, one of 64 signs associated with the Daoist philosophy and described in the Classic of Changes, the I Ching.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="designprocess">
               <p>Our Hexagram was Peace, which consists of 3 soft lines on top of 3 hard lines. Thus, we designed our chair to have 3 soft layers on top of 3 hard layers.</p>
               <p>We visited <a href="http://creativereuse.org">East Bay Depot for Creative Reuse</a> to find recycled materials for inspiration. We purchased a sturdy wine box, stuffing, and foam.</p>
               <p>The wine box had beautiful lettering etched into the wood. Wanting to make use of this design, we pursued creating a wine-inspired chair.</p>
               <p>Our hard layers consisted of three pieces of wood. We broke apart the wine box into four parts: three individual rectangular pieces, as well as one piece that would be used as the seat and the back of the chair. The box was nailed together, so we carefully restructured the box, recycling the nails that were provided. We sawed and sanded one rectangular piece into an oval shape on which we screwed in the legs. We then nailed in the seat of the chair, and put in more nails to the attachment between the seat and back of the chair to ensure the safety and stability of the chair.</p>
               <p>For our soft layers, we cut the foam into an oval shape that comfortably fit on top of the seat of the chair. We hot glued the upcycled stuffing onto the foam to create a soft pillow feel. Then, we shaped, cut, and sewed a sheet of wool around the pillow.</p>
               <p>For finishing touches, we stained the wood of the chair and painted the legs a red wine color.</p>
