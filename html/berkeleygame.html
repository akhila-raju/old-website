		<h3>Computer Science 10 Final Project</h3>
		<h5><i>An interactive game to teach entering freshmen how to get around UC Berkeley</i></h5>

		<p>Computer Science 10 was my first programming class. Given the open-ended nature of the project, my team decided to create a fun, visual-learning tool for incoming freshmen to familiarize themselves with the UC Berkeley campus.
		</p>
		<p>Users decide their departure and destination locations. They are prompted to turn at different intersections; throughout the "day" they will face several challenges and obstacles presented as games, such as avoiding flyering on Sproul Plaza and rushing to get food between classes. We implemented several interactive mini games, including:
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Calculating the price of food at campus dining. This consisted of addition, substraction, multiplication and division. Users have to quickly calculate the price of their food within a limited time frame. 
				</li>
				<li>Biking through Faculty Glade. Users have to navigate a biker through a crowded pathway, avoiding obstacles such as running squirrels and  pedestrians.
				</li>
				<li>Jaywalking across the street. Users have to navigate a person through a crosswalk while avoiding getting hit by cars and getting caught by UCPD.
				</li>
				<li>Avoiding people who are flyering in Sproul. Users have to move their character through Sproul Plaza without touching the flyerers who are chasing after them.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p><b>I designed the visualization of the campus map.</b> We didn't want the game to be too complex, so I decided to choose a portion of all of the campus buildings as destinations in this game, specifically those with lecture halls that can seat 300+ people (since these are popular locations for intro courses). I found the main pathways through campus that people traverse through, based on my team's own observation. I used straight lines to represent the pathways in order to simplify the visualization.
