            <p>lolExplore is a project for <a href=”http://vis.berkeley.edu/courses/cs294-10-fa14/wiki/index.php/Main_Page”>Data Visualization</a>, a Computer Science graduate course in which we “stud[ied] techniques and algorithms for creating effective visualizations based on principles and techniques from graphic design, visual art, perceptual psychology and cognitive science.”</p>

               <h2>Data Domain</h2>
                  <p>When thinking about possible data domains, we brainstormed several different ideas. Both of us had an interest in creating a visualization for video game statistics. We thought about visualizing aspects of multiple games, such as Legend of Zelda or Super Smash Brothers. After doing some research, we found that it might be difficult to actually compile data from these games since we would have to manually create our own dataset.</p>
                  <p>Jimmy is a frequent player of League of Legends with data from over 200 games. After looking at the Riot League of Legends API, we decided that this would be a really interesting topic to explore visually. We chose to use Jimmy's League of Legends match history to create "lolExplore," which allows us to visualize Jimmy's win rates across several filters.</p>
                  <p>The design of our visualization was inspired by UMD's HomeFinder.</p>

               <p>This is the starting screen of lolExplore, which provides an introductory text on how to interact with the visualization. The graph in the display is initially empty, since the x-variable hasn't been chosen yet. The user has to choose the x-variable.</p>

               <p>In this screen, the user can select the x-variable they want to visualize in the drop-down menu as shown. The user can apply filters to manipulate what data is shown in the graph. For the filters with two sliders, the range between the two sliders is applied to the graph.</p>

               <h2>Development Process and Implementation</h2>
               <p>We implemented the bar chart using time as the independent variable and win rate as the dependent variable to start off. We decided that having a changeable independent variable was too demanding given the scope of this project, so we are sticking to time, in terms of days of the week. Current League of Legends statistics aggregation sites mainly look at win rate per champion and changes in rank over time, but not win rate over time. Our goal with this visualization is to provide some insight into a player's statistics that is otherwise not found on the web. Win rate will always be the dependent variable for the purposes of this project since it is the main thing that League of Legends players are concerned with when looking at their match statistics.</p>
               <p>We consulted Mike Bostock's D3 tutorials in order to create our initial histogram. We combined jQuery, JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create our visualization.</p>
               <p>To start small, we created a visualization with filters for Kills, Deaths, and Assists. We decided it wasn't a good idea to initially show an empty graph at the start; we chose to show the graph with all data included.</p>
               <p>Until we made our first working prototype, we used Jimmy's match history, which consists of around 230 matches. We wanted to use a larger dataset in order to provide more accurate win rates for the user whose match history we were looking at. We looked at the League of Legends North American Challenger Bracket (which consists of the top 200 players), and wrangled the data of the top player. The dataset for this player consists of 519 matches, more than twice our original dataset. We changed the x-axis from days to hours of the day because it gave us a larger domain to work with, and it's more interesting, because we thought it was unlikely that the day of the week would have as much of an effect on win rate as the time of day. For example, will playing late at night lower the player's win rate due to sleep deprivation?</p>
               <p>We added another filter: Wards Placed. Wards are items that you can buy that give vision of a small area of the map for a limited period of time. This allows players to see the positions of their enemies and make more strategic decisions in their gameplay. Warding is an aspect of the game which is often overlooked by newer players, so we thought it would be nice to visualize the effect of more wards placed.</p>

               <p>One of our final questions was, how do we handle values with no corresponding data? For example, looking at the distribution of kills, there are no games in which Jimmy got 18 kills. We were thinking of placing an "X" where there are no values, but we decided to leave a blank space (no bars, empty column) where those values are missing. Later on, this became a bit frustrating as an empty space in our graph could signify either an hour in which no games were played or an hour in which all games were lost. As such, we made any hours in which no games are played red to signify that there are no values in that hour. Additionally, we created tooltips which display the number of games in each hour upon mouseover.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Demo</h2>
            <p>Our final visualization plots win rate (# of wins / # of games) vs. hour of the day (0-23 hours), and allows for filtering by 4 different variables via sliders: kills, deaths, assists and wards placed. Mousing over a bar in the chart will show a tooltip that displays how many games are in each hour of the day for the current data selection. Red bars indicate hours in which there is no data. Hours on which the win rate is 0 are indicated by a blue line on the x-axis.</p>

            </nav>

            <h2>Findings &amp; Source Code</h2>
            <p>By playing around with our visualization, we were able to see some clear effects of our variables on winrates. As one would expect, as kills go up, winrate does as well. Winrate is similarly positively correlated with assists, and negatively correlated with deaths. The impact of wards placed was not entirely clear through our visualization. We think that this is due to the fact that the number of wards placed is positively correlated with the length of the game (since players tend to ward throughout the course of the game). Thus, we would need to control for the length of the game in order to properly determine the relationships at play here. In fact, each one of our slider variables is presumably strongly positively correlated with the length of the game, so a future direction would be to account for match length across the entire visualization.</p>
