            <p>Thera started as a project for <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ucbsaas/">Software Engineering</a>, a Computer Science course where we "take an SaaS project from conception thru planning, development, assessment/testing, deployment, and operations, experiencing the attendant challenges of each stage, using [Ruby on Rails] for development and Cloud Computing for deployment." Thera is an anonymous chat platform that connects certified, locally-sourced volunteers with survivors of sexual assault.</p>
            <p>I am the Chief Technology Officer and Full-Stack Developer of my team's SaaS application, having led a team of 5 full-stack developers and spearheading design, planning, development, testing, and deployment.</p>

            <div id="problem">
               <h2>Problem</h2>
               <p>Stigma attached to rape culture reinforces an environment that silences survivors from speaking about their experiences and hinders them from accessing the proper resources. 1 in 4 college women and 1 in 33 college men are sexually assaulted by the time they graduate. 2 in 5 do not tell anyone about their assault due to various circumstances, including the stigma surrounding rape culture. Stigma attached to rape culture reinforces an environment that silences survivors from speaking about their experiences and hinders them from accessing the proper resources.</p>

            <div id="process">
               <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>Designed, planned, developed, tested, and deployed a SAAS application for a nonprofit startup using Ruby on Rails, HTML and CSS, RSpec, Cucumber</p>
               	<h4>Development</h4>
        				<p>We used agile development and extreme programming methodologies and tools. This includes but is not limited to: behavior-driven development, version control, user stories, and low-fidelity mockups.</p>
        				<h4>Design</h4>
        				<p>We created low-fidelity mockups throughout the development cycle and iterated and improved on design with feedback from the client. We changed the design and improved the mockups as features were implemented. Since our team's vision was aligned with the vision of our client, communication and the design process went very smoothly.</p>

               <p>We used the Faye gem, a publish-subscribe messaging system, to manage chats in realtime.</p>

 -->               <h4><p>Commit to master branch of every working feature to not risk losing progress</p></h4>
              <p>No one committed, someone did a git reset, lost everything.</p>
               <h4><p>Research and analyze assumptions of how much work each feature needs before starting implementation</p></h4>
              <p>Even though we separated the development into iterations, we still ran into trouble regarding how realistic we were about how much work we could get done. We underestimated the amount of time and resources it would take to implement some features. We should have made assignments that were clearly someone's responsibility - make it more formal, instead of discussing.</p>
