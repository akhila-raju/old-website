            <p>During Summer 2015, I was an Engineering Program Manager for the Touch ID Team at Apple Headquarters. Because the projects I worked on are undisclosed, I cannot provide details of the work I did; I can only speak to the skills I learned.</p>

            <div id="programmgt">
               <h2>Program Management</h2>
               <h4><p>New Technology Development Backlog, Feature Prioritization, &amp; Kickoff</p></h4>
               <p>I created the overall product development plan for an undisclosed new technology development. I created and maintained the product backlog for the Electrical Engineering, Software, Firmware, Qualitative Assessment, and the Algorithms teams. I prioritized feature development with feedback from the managers of each team. I oversaw the development of said features, ensuring that each task was delivered on time.</p>
               <p>I prepared the kickoff deck for the new technology development presented to senior management, which included the product development plan I created. Due to the end date of my internship, I didn't have the opportunity to present the kickoff.</p>
               <h4><p>iPhone 6S Touch ID</p></h4>
               <p>I maintained and revised the product development plan for Touch ID on the iPhone 6S with Engineering. I actively assessed and mitigated risks by communicating with cross-functional teams. I also learned how to predict and avoid future risks.</p>
               <h4><p>Working with Senior Management</p></h4>
               <p>During my internship, I created and presented status reports to senior management in Program Management and in Engineering.</p>
               <h4><p>Key Contribution</p></h4>
               <p>The biggest impact I made while working at Apple was pitching and persuading senior management to test a significant use case that wasn't considered in the past. By conducting user research and presenting the utility of testing said use case and a common use case scenario, I successfully convinced senior management to test the use case for the new technology development.</p>

            <div id="userstudies">
               <h2>User Studies &amp; Product Spec Development</h2>
               <p>I designed and developed several user studies for Touch ID and 3D Touch on the iProduct line (including iPhone 6S), as well as an undisclosed new technology development. These studies tested utility and usability on UI/UX for touch. Engineering provided the hypotheses that they wanted tested, and I directed the rest of the process. I created the user study protocols and iterated on them with feedback from QA, Engineering, and the User Studies Team. I conducted the studies, collected and analyzed data, and presented the findings to senior management.</p>
               <p>I worked with engineers and senior management to prioritize key features and develop the final product spec for the new technology development with the knowledge gained from the user studies I conducted.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="lessonslearned">
               <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
               <p>During my time at Apple, I learned key skills in program management, user study design and development, as well as working with cross-functional teams.</p>
               <h4><p>Technical Details &amp; Information Detail</p></h4>
               <p>I learned to discern key information from numerous meetings with engineers, and communicate tasks and task priorities to cross-functional teams in a timely manner. I learned how to communicate technical details with Engineering, and how to communicate user study results to engineering teams and the User Studies team. I learned to differentiate between the amount of detail necessary for status reports to engineering, and the succinct points to present during status reports to senior-level management.</p>
               <h4><p>Metrics</p></h4>
               <p>I learned the importance of using metrics to discuss product development and to support product decisions.</p>
               <h4><p>Risk Mitigation</p></h4>
               <p>I learned how to actively predict, assess, and work with engineering to mitigate risks during the product development lifecycle.</p>
               <h4><p>Cross-Functional Teamwork</p></h4>
               <p>I actively sought and developed a rapport with engineers and program managers in cross-functional teams. I sought to understand more of the technical details of the projects I was working on so I could communicate with engineers easier and contribute more to meetings. Reaching out to colleagues in cross-functional teams allowed me to expand my technical knowledge and my program management knowledge.</p>

            <div id="recommendations">
               <h2>Recommendations</h2>
               <h4><p>Rui Jin, Hardware Sensor Systems Architect</p></h4>
               <p>"Akhila was a valuable contributor to the team at Apple. She is detail-oriented and motivated to get results even on an extremely tight schedule. Akhila is a competent team player and is effective at working cross-functionally in large team environments. She picks up technical knowledge rapidly and is happy to work outside her comfort zone of expertise. Despite being new to the organization, she proactively envisioned and implemented new ideas. Akhila is a pleasure to interact with and I am looking forward to working with her in the future."</p>
